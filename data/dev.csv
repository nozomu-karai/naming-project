MSMARCO-Conversational-Search,"Truly Conversational Search is the next logic step in the journey to generate intelligent and useful AI. To understand what this may mean, researchers have voiced a continuous desire to study how people currently converse with search engines. Traditionally, the desire to produce such a comprehensive dataset has been limited because those who have this data (Search Engines) have a responsibility to their users to maintain their privacy and cannot share the data publicly in a way that upholds the trusts users have in the Search Engines. Given these two powerful forces we believe we have a dataset and paradigm that meets both sets of needs: A artificial public dataset that approximates the true data and an ability to evaluate model performance on the real user behavior. What this means is we released a public dataset which is generated by creating artificial sessions using embedding similarity and will test on the original data. To say this again: we are not releasing any private user data but are releasing what we believe to be a good representation of true user interactions."
