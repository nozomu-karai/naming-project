MSMARCO-Conversational-Search,"Truly Conversational Search is the next logic step in the journey to generate intelligent and useful AI. To understand what this may mean, researchers have voiced a continuous desire to study how people currently converse with search engines. Traditionally, the desire to produce such a comprehensive dataset has been limited because those who have this data (Search Engines) have a responsibility to their users to maintain their privacy and cannot share the data publicly in a way that upholds the trusts users have in the Search Engines. Given these two powerful forces we believe we have a dataset and paradigm that meets both sets of needs: A artificial public dataset that approximates the true data and an ability to evaluate model performance on the real user behavior. What this means is we released a public dataset which is generated by creating artificial sessions using embedding similarity and will test on the original data. To say this again: we are not releasing any private user data but are releasing what we believe to be a good representation of true user interactions."
OpenKP,"Automatically extracting keyphrases that are salient to the document meanings is an essential step to semantic document understanding. An effective keyphrase extraction (KPE) system can benefit a wide range of natural language processing and information retrieval tasks. Recent neural methods formulate the task as a document-to-keyphrase sequence-to-sequence task. These seq2seq learning models have shown promising results compared to previous KPE systems The recent progress in neural KPE is mostly observed in documents originating from the scientific domain. In real-world scenarios, most potential applications of KPE deal with diverse documents originating from sparse sources. These documents are unlikely to include the structure, prose and be as well written as scientific papers. They often include a much diverse document structure and reside in various domains whose contents target much wider audiences than scientists. To encourage the research community to develop a powerful neural model with key phrase extraction on open domains we have created OpenKP: a dataset of over 150,000 documents with the most relevant keyphrases generated by expert annotation."

CryptoNets,"CryptoNets is a demonstration of the use of Neural-Networks over data encrypted with Homomorphic Encryption. Homomorphic Encryptions allow performing operations such as addition and multiplication over data while it is encrypted. Therefore, it allows keeping data private while outsourcing computation (see here and here for more about Homomorphic Encryptions and its applications). This project demonstrates the use of Homomorphic Encryption for outsourcing neural-network predictions. The scenario in mind is a provider that would like to provide Prediction as a Service (PaaS) but the data for which predictions are needed may be private. This may be the case in fields such as health or finance. By using CryptoNets, the user of the service can encrypt their data using Homomorphic Encryption and send only the encrypted message to the service provider. Since Homomorphic Encryptions allow the provider to operate on the data while it is encrypted, the provider can make predictions using a pre-trained Neural-Network while the data remains encrypted throughout the process and finaly send the prediction to the user who can decrypt the results. During the process the service provider does not learn anything about the data that was used, the prediction that was made or any intermediate result since everything is encrypted throughout the process. This project uses the Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library SEAL version 3.2.1 implementation of Homomorphic Encryption developed in Microsoft Research."

In contrast, we propose a one-stage solution which does detection and tracking with a single network by elegantly solving the alignment problem. The resulting approach achieves groundbreaking results in terms of both accuracy and speed: (1) it ranks first among all the trackers on the MOT challenges; (2) it is significantly faster than the previous state-of-the-arts. In addition, it scales gracefully to handle a large number of objects. "
